# Content Design Process

How dungeon content gets designed for this project, captured from the
"dungeon deepening" pass that extended `level_03` into `level_04`/`level_05`
and reframed the whole run as one narrative arc. Read this before authoring
new levels or retuning existing ones.

## 1. Narrative framing

Settle the throughline **before** drawing any map. The engine only exposes
two story surfaces to the player: a level's `name` (shown in the HUD) and an
entity/item's `description` (shown in look mode, `engine/render.py`
`describe_tile`). Everything narrative has to work through those two fields
- there's no separate lore/dialogue system, and there shouldn't be one added
just to tell a story (see `flee_hp_pct` gotcha below for what happens when
content assumes mechanics the engine doesn't have).

Current arc, as a worked example - one continuous descent through
progressively older ruins beneath a manor's basement:

| Level | Name | Beat |
|---|---|---|
| `level_01` | The Rotting Cellar | mundane decay, present-day squatters |
| `level_02a` | The Flooded Crypt | older burial ruins, path A |
| `level_02b` | The Goblin Warren | older burial ruins, path B |
| `level_03` | The Sunless Throne | a seat of old power - looks like the end, isn't |
| `level_04` | The Elder Ossuary | older still, bone-filled |
| `level_05` | The First Ruin | the true bottom, origin of everything above |

Each name alone should signal escalating age/depth even out of context. If a
new level's name doesn't obviously slot into the arc, the arc needs
revisiting before the level does.

## 2. Balance methodology

Damage is `max(0, attacker.attack - defender.defense)`
(`engine/combat.py`). Player baseline is `PLAYER_MAX_HP`/`PLAYER_ATTACK`/
`PLAYER_DEFENSE` in `engine/game_map.py` (30/5/1 as of this writing), before
any picked-up weapon (`attack_bonus` items) or potions (`heal_amount`).

**Work out hits-to-kill in both directions** before placing a monster:
`player_attack - monster.defense` and `monster.attack - player.defense`,
against current `data/entities.yaml` stats. This is what caught the ogre
being a ~14-hit slog at base stats (`8` attack, `3` defense, `28` hp) - not
a bug, but it means the ogre should never be the *first* though fight a
player can reach without a weapon upgrade already in hand.

**Check gear fairness across branching paths specifically.** Two branches
that never reconverge can each be internally balanced and still create a
problem: `level_02a` (Flooded Crypt) offers no weapon at all, only a potion,
while `level_02b` (Goblin Warren) has the `iron_sword`. That's a fine
risk/reward asymmetry between two *parallel* paths - but both eventually
funnel into the same `level_03` -> `level_04` -> `level_05` continuation, so
a player who took 02a would otherwise never see a weapon upgrade before the
endgame. Fix used here: place a second `iron_sword` in `level_04`, past the
convergence point, rather than editing the branches (which would have
erased the intentional asymmetry). General rule: **audit item availability
at every point where paths reconverge**, not just within each branch.

**The flee-threshold gotcha** (see memory `balance_flee_hp_threshold`):
`skittish` monsters only check `hp/max_hp <= flee_hp_pct` on their own turn,
*after* the player's hit that round has already landed. If `max_hp` is low
enough that one hit can drop the monster straight through the threshold to
0, the flee behavior is dead content - it never triggers. Give any
`skittish` monster enough `max_hp` to survive at least one expected player
hit with room below that to spare before `flee_hp_pct` kicks in.

## 3. Structural design

- **Linear vs. branching**: a branch should represent a real choice (see
  02a/02b) - two distinct encounters/tones, not the same content twice with
  reskinned monsters. Converge branches back to a shared level rather than
  running parallel chains indefinitely; use the convergence point to correct
  any fairness gap the branches created (see balance methodology above).
- **AI variety as a pacing tool, not decoration** (`content/schema.py`
  `AIType`, dispatch in `engine/engine.py` `_perform_ai`):
  - `hostile_basic` - a straightforward combat encounter, use for anything
    meant to just be fought.
  - `sleeping_guard` - rewards caution/careful movement; use where the level
    wants the player to feel like they're *sneaking* rather than clearing.
  - `skittish` - rewards controlled, deliberate aggression and punishes
    overkill; use for weak/numerous creatures where a chase would be more
    interesting than a guaranteed kill.
- **Locked doors/keys are reward gates, not path gates**: place them off the
  critical path, guarding a bonus item, so a level is always completable
  without finding the key. Every door/key pair used so far follows this
  (`level_01`, `level_04`).

## 4. Authoring checklist

1. **Layout**: reuse a proven template from an existing `data/levels/*.lvl`
   file where the composition fits (two-room-plus-vault, single open room,
   etc.) - copying known-good row geometry and only substituting the symbols
   at specific positions avoids the width-mismatch mistakes hand-drawing a
   grid from scratch invites.
2. **Placements**: exactly one `player_start`, at least one `stairs_down`,
   monsters (with AI chosen deliberately per the pacing guidance above),
   items (checked against the balance methodology above).
3. **Flavor text**: level `name` and every entity/item `description` fit
   the narrative arc - these are the only things the player actually reads.
4. **Validate**: `python tools/preview.py data/levels` - reviews the whole
   dungeon's rendering, stairway destinations, and door/key pairings at
   once, and is how loader validation errors (bad references, ragged rows,
   missing stairs) get caught before anything runs.
5. **Test and playtest**: `pytest`, then `python main.py` to actually feel
   out pacing and difficulty - the math in step 2 is a sanity check, not a
   substitute for playing it.
